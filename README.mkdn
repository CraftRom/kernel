CraftRom
===========

Getting started
---------------

To initialize your local repository using the LineageOS trees, use a command like this:
```
repo init -u https://github.com/CraftRom/kernel -b nightly
```
Then to sync up:
```
repo sync
```

Buildbot
--------

All supported devices are built weekly and periodically as changes are committed to ensure the source trees remain buildable.

You can view the current build statuses at [CraftRom Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/craftrom).
